Lawmakers had previously failed to reach an agreement on Bukele's proposal because of concerns about the size of the loan and the president's justification of some of the expenses that he had included in the application for the loan.

After storming the parliament, Bukele said a prayer from a seat normally occupied by the president of the parliament, Mario Ponce. Before leaving the building, Bukele gave lawmakers one week to approve his loan proposal.

At the time of his election, Bukele was seen by many as an outsider, populist candidate, who campaigned on slogans criticizing those who'd come before him, such as "there's enough money when nobody steals" and "return what was stolen," referring to the alleged disappearance of funds during the administrations of former presidents Francisco Flores and Antonio saca.
